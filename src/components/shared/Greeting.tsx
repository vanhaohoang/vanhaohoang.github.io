      Hi everyone! I’m Hào. After earning my master’s degree in Applied Mathematics in France, I returned to Vietnam to continue my career and passion for AI and Mathematics. I’m very enthusiastic about AI, both as a researcher and as an engineer building products. Currently, I work full-time as a Senior AI Engineer at Spartan and part-time as a researcher for the International Society of Data Scientists on weekends. Both roles are remote in the US. 
  
      In my spare time, I love working on {projectsLinkElement} hands-on applied AI projects and exploring the mathematics behind them to share knowledge and help others learn. I also work on other {projectsLinkElement} focusing on Python syntax and Data Science. 
  
      Additionally, I write {blogLinkElement} about my life, my experiences studying abroad, living in big cities, and my time spent in my hometown. Nice to meet you all!
    </p>
