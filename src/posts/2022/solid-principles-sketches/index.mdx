I've recently launched the minimalistic drawing app [okso.app](https://okso.app/) that allows you to do interactive (nested) sketches. And, as a continuation of my previous [S.O.L.I.D. Principles Around You](https://trekhleb.dev/blog/2017/solid-principles-around-you/) article, I've organized it in [interactive sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/solid) that you may find [here](https://okso.app/showcase/solid).

Check what I've got:

So, each SOLID principle has a dedicated sketch page that look like the following

## Single Responsibility Principle

[SRP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/924000bf-21ec-4580-36f4-49ee920abe55)

A class should have only a single responsibility. Only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

## Open/Closed Principle

[OCP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/f297d650-5343-4423-39b9-6a1dbb21e5df)

Software entities should be open for EXTENSION, but closed for MODIFICATION. Allow behavior to be extended without modifying the source code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

[LSP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/2899b427-2bd8-4899-16a7-0ce855331ba2)

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

[ISP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/5464baff-5793-482a-0dfa-bab4337fe3ed)

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

[DIP Sketch](https://okso.app/showcase/solid/page/70a27e39-47db-4ada-2065-f023372e1933)

One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

> In the future I plan to add more visual explainers like this one to the [okso.app showcase](https://okso.app/showcase). Currently there is a [Data Structures](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) sketch is available that is done in a similar style as SOLID one. I hope having such visual explainers in one place will be convenient for you.
