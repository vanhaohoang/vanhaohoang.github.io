Recently I launched the minimalistic online drawing app [okso.app](https://okso.app). I wanted it to be a place where people could do fast, ad-hoc, napkin-based-like explanations of any concept as if you are sitting with your friend and trying to explain him/her something during lunch. Don't ask me why it is needed, I was just experimenting.

> Btw, that's why the app name is "Ok! So...", because oftentimes these are the opening words after you pick up the pen and the piece of paper (or a whiteboard) and start drawing. I didn't see the study and the statistics of the opening phrases though, so I might be wrong here, here üòÄ

So, the first concept I've tried to explain with sketches was the Data Structures. Without further ado, here is the interactive ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase that you may play with.

> Here is a [YouTube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaOWTOWOWGk) of the GIF just in case.

Of course, not all data structures are covered. And of course, this is not comprehensive material, but rather a cheatsheet that would create visual hints and associations for the following data structures:

- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Hash Table (with hash collision resolution)
- Tree (including the Binary Search Tree)
- Heap (including Mean Heap and Max Heap)
- Trie
- Graph

Each box on the sketch is clickable, so you may dig into the data structure you're interested. For example `Heap ‚Üí Max Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Min Heap`, or `Heap ‚Üí Array Representation`.

The sketches are split into so-called Pages just to make it easier to grasp them, so the users stay focused on one concept at a time, they see the relationship between the concept, and thus, hopefully, they are not getting overwhelmed with seeing a lot of information at the same time on one drawing/page.

Each page has a link to the source-code examples that are implementing the data structure on JavaScript.

Here are some examples of the sketches.

**Doubly Linked List**

**Tree**

**Hash Table**

**Trie**

**Graph**

The full list you may find in the ‚úçüèª [Data Structure Sketches](https://okso.app/showcase/data-structures) showcase.

I hope you find this showcase useful and I hope it will be a good visual cheatsheet-like complement to your data structure knowledge.
